# ScanME
#### Repo for CodeDay NY project, ScanME

Created for CodeDay NY, ScanMe is an app in the works. The original concept was to create an app to scan what you're wearing, then bring back a list of results from various retaliers that returns similar clothing. Built with Python + Flask in 5 hours, ScanMe is a fun little project that I enjoyed working with.

Things still left to do:

1. Implement a Camera in the Browser
2. Get Camera to take picture and save it
3. Create algorithm to scan image for colors/patterns
4. Create a way to convert Hex color code to color search, probably using 3D space coordinates and distance formula
5. ~~Search that color and clothing item through various clothing retailers~~
